# Email Reader
This simple dual python script scans through recent emails and checks if a specified person has sent an email. This email is then downloaded (including any attachments) into a specifed directory. This process happens on every startup and is automatic.

To read emails, firstly you must use gmail and then plug in a porvided authentication code. (For more information on how to do that go here: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447)

All files are created by the script upon creation, no manual work is needed.
